W205, Fall 2016, Exercise 1
Data Architecture and Assumptions
Laura Williams

The following assumptions have been made for running scripts for Exercise 1:

They will be run on an AWS “UCB W205 Spring 2016” AMI,
ideally on at least an m3.large instance (for better processing speed),
with an attached EBS volume of at least 30GB,
with security rules modified for access to Hadoop and Spark web interfaces (as specified in Lab 2),
where permissions of the /data directory have been set to readable, writable and executable by all users,
which has been formatted and set up for Hadoop, YARN, Hive, and PostgreSQL (via the setup script in Lab 2),
and on which Spark and the Hive Metastore have been set up (via the setup script in Lab 3).

It is assumed that the /data directory has been mounted,
that Hadoop, Postgres and Hive Metastore have already been started,
and that the user has been switched to w205.

Location of script files:
It is assumed that 
[all scripts?  or just which ones?
load_data_lake.sh]
will be copied from my github repository to the /home/w205 folder on the EBS specified above.
