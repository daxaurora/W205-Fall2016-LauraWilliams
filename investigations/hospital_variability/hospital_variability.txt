Question 3: Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

I interpreted this question to mean: for each procedure, measure the variability of scores among all hospitals. I chose to measure variability as the greatest range of scores for each procedure.

From the Mortality Scores table and the Effective Care table, I measured the range of scores for each procedure (maximum score minus minimum score for each procedure) and then ranked the procedures based on the range of scores.

The top 10 procedures with the greatest variability among hospitals are as follows:

Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients		1151.0
Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients		601.0
Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention- Reporting Rate									404.0
Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients	381.0
Median Time from ED Arrival to Provider Contact for ED patients		152.0
Median Time to Pain Management for Long Bone Fracture			128.0
Antithrombotic Therapy By End of Hospital Day 2				100.0
Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis						100.0
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis					100.0
Thrombolytic Therapy								100.0
