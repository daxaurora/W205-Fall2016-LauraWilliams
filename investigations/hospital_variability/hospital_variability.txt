Question 3: Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

I interpreted this question to mean: for each procedure, measure the variability of scores among all hospitals. I chose to measure variability as the greatest range of scores for each procedure.

From the Mortality Scores table and the Effective Care table, I measured the range of scores for each procedure (maximum score minus minimum score for each procedure) and then ranked the procedures based on the range of scores.

The top 10 procedures with the greatest variability among hospitals are as follows:

Left without being seen					506609.0
Median Time from ED Arrival to Provider Contact 
for ED patients						104781.0
Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for 
Discharged ED Patients					97298.0
Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for 
Admitted Patients					6164.0
Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for 
Admitted ED Patients					6164.0
Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis			6074.0
Influenza Immunization					4984.0
Surgery Patients Who Received Appropriate Venous 
Thromboembolism Prophylaxis Within 24 Hours Prior 
to Surgery to 24 Hours After Surgery			1904.0
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis		1881.0
Assessed for Rehabilitation				1788.0
